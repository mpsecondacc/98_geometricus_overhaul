                        <p>LIDAR technology (Light Detection and Ranging) is one of the laser scanning methods used to observe the earth's surface and objects on it. LIDAR is an optical measuring instrument that uses light in the form of a laser beam to measure the distance between the sensor and the measurement object. The distance is determined using the speed of light and the time required for the laser beam to reach the observed object. In combination with other data recorded by recording, the light pulses generate precise three-dimensional data about the earth's surface and the objects located on it. LIDAR systems consist of a laser scanner and a signal receiver, as well as a GNSS receiver and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The laser scanner emits a certain signal, and the receiver reads the return signal, while using the GPS receiver and the inertial measurement unit, it is possible to determine the three-dimensional position and orientation of the recorded area or the object in that area</p>
                        
                         <p class="ay-2"> Topographic LIDAR uses near-infrared radiation to collect data. Its characteristic is that upon contact with vegetation, part of the beam is reflected and the height of the vegetation is registered, and part passes to another surface from which part of the beam will also be reflected, that is, it passes to the ground where the rest of the beam will be reflected. Topographic LIDAR is used to obtain information on the height and density of vegetation, to map land and coastal areas, to create various digital models, and the like.</p>
                         <p class="ay-2">In this way, it is possible to obtain a digital terrain model of forested and hard-to-reach areas in a very short period of time.</p>
